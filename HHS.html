                <h3>PRE-PRIMARY (Pre-Nursery to Class II)</h3>
                <p>The ethos of the Pre-Primary Section of HHS is to provide our youngest students with lots of 
                    tenderness and a colourful, stimulating and happy setting, to make coming to school fun and 
                    exciting! We strive to create a home outside of the home where children develop a sense of 
                    belonging and begin their academic journey in a friendly and caring environment.

                    At HHS we believe that children learn by doing, and take a student-centered approach to make
                    'learning' a pleasant and inspiring experience for the child. The School's unique Pre-Primary 
                    model of education, developed over decades, combines play, material use, and experiences, 
                    with a high standard of traditional literacy and numeracy skills to provide a solid academic 
                    foundation for our students.</p>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h4>PRIMARY (Grade II-V)</h4>

                    of both activities and academics. We at HHS, make sure that the transition is smooth and 
                    well-received by the students. With the primary focus still on the 'Hands-On Learning' approach- 
                    our students become active thinkers and problem solvers.
