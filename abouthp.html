    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Happy Palace Group of Schools was established towards the end of the twentieth century (1982). With a rich history of forty years (41 years), the School leads as a symbol of educational aspiration for students with a special purpose of providing quality education at an affordable price. At a time, when government allocation and spending were minimal on the education sector, HPGS established itself as one of the leading education providers in the city.
