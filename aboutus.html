            <h2>MESSAGE FROM THE BOARD</h2>
            <p>“At The City School, our motto is “I am to Learn” because we believe that learning is limitless. We aim to develop each one of our students into true learners, individuals who always seek to broaden their perspective and face life’s challenges with courage and conviction.

                For us, education is a pursuit that goes far beyond a qualification and we ensure that our teachers, staff members and students along with parents work together to achieve this goal.”

   <h3>OUR VALUES</h3>
    <img src="our-values.jpg">

    <p>We have moved with times, but we have not lost sight of our values and traditions.
        At The City School we genuinely believe in educating “the whole child” so we provide our students with every opportunity to discover and build upon their strengths.
        
        We also expect them to face up to the challenges of an economically globalized and socially changing world  one in which they will have to take their place as independent, responsible citizens.</p>
