                    <p>Beaconhouse students have consistently produced outstanding Matriculation results with numerous 
                        position-holders over the years. Matriculation is a two-year programme culminating in the Class X examination. The curriculum and examination is administered by Pakistani federal and provincial education boards. Most students who pass this examination are 16 years old.</p>

                    <h4>CIE O LEVEL AND IGCSE</h4>
                       <p>O Levels are a standard UK qualification, usually taken at the age of 16, available in a wide 
                        range of subjects. Most students take between seven and 10 O Level subjects and study for two to three years. Beaconhouse students have consistently performed well in the O Level examinations, with 19 students receiving distinctions across Pakistan in 2016.
                        IGCSE is a curriculum developed by Cambridge for 14 to 16 year olds and is the international 
                        equivalent of the Cambridge O Level. Even though just a few of our schools offer IGCSE as an 
                        option, students perform well in the examinations and results remain above average.</p>

            <h3>Shahid Ali Khan:</h3>
            <p>Appreciate the constant communication from school and teachers to let us know how our daughter is doing.
                They have split into two campuses now and we hope to go to the new one next year. Very friendly staff.
            </p>

                <h3>Ahmed Al BAalushi:</h3>
                <p>The school has done a good job despite the pandemic. The Principal has a coffee evening with parents
                    every Tuesday to discuss what the school is doing and if we have any concerns we want to voice. They
                    have a new campus in Al Khuwair where we go with good facilities. The safety precautions they are 
                    taking are well applied and the teachers are kind to us</p>
