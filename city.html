        <h2>Curriculum & Academics Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The City School has consistently maintained its standards and is viewed as a benchmark for excellence. Our commitment to provide a holistic quality education is at the core of everything we do.
            We have a lowest student teacher ratio, which ensures that every child gets the required attention and customized plan according to their needs. We guide our students from their Early Years all the way till their Cambridge International Examination (CAIE).
            Our curriculum bolsters curiosity, critical thinking and creativity assuring that our students have the knowledge, skillset and values to prosper in their future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footer-col">
        <h2>School Improvement & Quality Assurance (SIQA)</h2>
        <p>The City School has had a well-established system of school inspections since 2002. Over time, the frameworks and processes for assuring quality evolved, leading to the development of a contextualised framework for SIQA, in line with international best practices.

            Our primary focus at SIQA is to ensure that all our schools are self-improving schools; evidence-based, valid, and reliable self-evaluation informs improvement planning, leading the schools to be centres of academic excellence, and the school leadership to exhibit strong internal capacity to make year-on-year improvements.
            SIQA runs a partnership model with the school leadership, in order to guide and support them in embedding self-evaluation in their schoolâ€™s routines for informed decision-making. The SIQA Partners act as critical friends; providing challenge and support to the school leaders in order to develop their capacity in gaining insights into how well their schools are performing and taking targeted steps towards improvement, eventually contributing to improved student outcomes.
